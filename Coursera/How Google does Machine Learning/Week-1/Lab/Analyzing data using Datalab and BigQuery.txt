Ensure the Cloud Source Repositories API is enabled: 
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/sourcerepo.googleapis.com/?q=Repositories

Launch Cloud Datalab
1. Open Cloud Shell. The cloud shell icon is at the top right of the Google Cloud Platform web console
2. gcloud compute zones list
3. datalab create mydatalabvm --zone <ZONE>

Invoke BigQuery
1. Navigate to the BigQuery console by selecting BigQuery from the top-left-corner ("hamburger") menu.
2. In the BigQuery Console, click on Compose Query. Then, select Show Options and ensure that the Legacy SQL menu is NOT checked (we will be using Standard SQL).
3. In the query textbox, type:
#standardSQL
SELECT
  departure_delay,
  COUNT(1) AS num_flights,
  APPROX_QUANTILES(arrival_delay, 5) AS arrival_delay_quantiles
FROM
  `bigquery-samples.airline_ontime_data.flights`
GROUP BY
  departure_delay
HAVING
  num_flights > 100
ORDER BY
  departure_delay ASC
4. Look back at Cloud Shell, and follow any prompts. If asked for a ssh passphrase, just hit return (for no passphrase).
5. Can you write a query to find the airport pair (departure and arrival airport) that had the maximum number of flights between them?
#standardSQL
SELECT
  departure_airport,
  arrival_airport,
  COUNT(1) AS num_flights
FROM
  `bigquery-samples.airline_ontime_data.flights`
GROUP BY
  departure_airport,
  arrival_airport
ORDER BY
  num_flights DESC
LIMIT
  10

Draw graphs in Cloud Datalab
1. If necessary, wait for Datalab to finish launching. Datalab is ready when you see a message prompting you to do a "Web Preview".
2. Click on the Web Preview icon on the top-right corner of the Cloud Shell ribbon. Switch to port 8081.
3. In Cloud Datalab home page (browser), navigate into notebooks. You should now be in datalab/notebooks/
4. Start a new notebook by clicking on the +Notebook icon. Rename the notebook to be flights.
5. In a cell in Datalab, type the following, then click Run
query="""
SELECT
  departure_delay,
  COUNT(1) AS num_flights,
  APPROX_QUANTILES(arrival_delay, 10) AS arrival_delay_deciles
FROM
  `bigquery-samples.airline_ontime_data.flights`
GROUP BY
  departure_delay
HAVING
  num_flights > 100
ORDER BY
  departure_delay ASC

import google.datalab.bigquery as bq
df = bq.Query(query).execute().result().to_dataframe()
df.head()
6. In the next cell in Datalab, type the following, then click Run
import pandas as pd
percentiles = df['arrival_delay_deciles'].apply(pd.Series)
percentiles = percentiles.rename(columns = lambda x : str(x*10) + "%")
df = pd.concat([df['departure_delay'], percentiles], axis=1)
df.head()
7. In the next cell in Datalab, type the following, then click Run
without_extremes = df.drop(['0%', '100%'], 1)
without_extremes.plot(x='departure_delay', xlim=(-30,50), ylim=(-50,50));
